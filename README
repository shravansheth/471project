Compilation- 
To compile the project, run:
make

Running-
After compiling, run the executable with:
./BaseP2

Dog Animation-
Press the SPACEBAR to trigger the dog animation.
The dog walks from its starting location toward the bowl with a small bobbing motion for realism.
The animation stops automatically once it reaches the bowl.

Particle Effects-
A particle system simulates wood dust or sparks when the robot’s hammer strikes the table.
Particles burst only when the hammer hits the lowest point of the swing and then fade out as they rise.

Camera Movement-
You can freely move around the scene using the camera controls:
W – Move forward
S – Move backward
A – Move left
D – Move right

The camera uses pitch and yaw controlled by the mouse/trackpad.
This allows full free-look exploration of the environment.
